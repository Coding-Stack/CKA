docker stores the files inside /var/lib/docker folder
- aufs
- containers
- image
- volumes

- docker following the layered architecture where each line is one layer. The benefit is if 
  we are having the same layer in other image(build already) we can map it with that so 
  no need to build again.
- docker volume create vname will create the volume
  and we can mount this volume by docker run -v vname:path_to_mount image, it will create the volume
  if not present and we can also provide the custom volume path by absolute path
-  we can also use an alternate method:
   docker run --mount type=bind,source=dummy,target=dummy image
- docker uses storage drivers to manage this i.e, aufs,zfs,overlay
- volume drivers are help to create the volumes ex: local(default), netapp,convoy
  we can choose the volume driver in docker run command via --volume-driver option
