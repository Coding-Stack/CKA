- we taint the node to allow only those pods who can tolrate that taint (pods are tolerated)
- kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect
- taint-effect can be NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule or NoExecute (if already scheduled, then evicted)
- toleration is added in pod.spec.tolerations under key,operator(Equal), value and effect. all should be in doule quotes
- master node is bydefault tainted by NoSchedule
