- we can add our own multiple custom schedulers. 
- we can use the same manifest as of the default scheduler, change the name 
  leader-elect: if multiple copy of a scheduler is running on diff master node then one can be 
                active at a time so leader-elect option help out there
- lock-object-name: <name> : it is to differentiate b/w default and custom scheduler. it will lock that scheduler
- scheduler-name: mention the name of custom scheduler here
- we can add scheduler-name in pod manifest inside spec.schedulerName section
