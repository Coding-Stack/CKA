- if there is no master node at all then how kubelet will manage the things.
  we maintain the manifest inside /etc/kubernetes/manifests directory and kubelet also lookup for them
  so we can place pod manifest there and kubelet can take care about the pod after ward
- if the file removed from this directly then it will also delete the pod
- we can also create the pods this way, known as static pods
- we have mentioned this directory path inside kubelet itself while creating it (kubelet.service)
  Or we can add a configfile inside .service file and add the staticPodPath in the config file
- we can check the static pod by docker ps command only not by kubectl commands (kubeapi missing)
- kubeapi server aware about static pods too, we can access them by kubectl commands too
  but can't edit or delete them only view them. it can be deleted from the directory itself
- we can use static pod to deploy the control plane pods itself.
- static pods as well as daemonsets both are ignored by the scheduler.
