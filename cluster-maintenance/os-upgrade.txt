- node drain: terminate the pods and scheduled them on the other nodes. and marked that node
              as cordon(unschedulable)
- cordon: it just marked the node as unschedulable not terminate the pods
- uncordon: it is reverse of cordon, marked the node as schedulable again
- we need to use --ignore-daemonsets flag if ds in running on the node
- we need a --force flag is a pod is running on that node
