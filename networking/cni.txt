- all the n/w related tasks -- creation of ns,veth,giveip and all can be come under cni plugins 
  to make it simple
- we add invoke bridge via bridge add <cid> <namespace>

- docker don't have cni plugin directly so the kubernetes create a docker container via
  none network mode and ru bridge command after that to add cni plugins(setup network).

<cni-weave>
- weave is deployed as daemonsets in the cluster each replica of the weave is communicate with each other
  and help the pods to share the packet among large cluster because in standard way we have to add multiple
  queries inside route table and difficult to manage
