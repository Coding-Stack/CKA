- we use use proxy server b/w cluster and dns to listen on 80 or custom port instead of a nodeport
- we will create a service of type loadbalancer then it ask the gcp to create a loadbalancer
  which automatically expose a external ip to tthe user, no need for proxy-server in that case
- for every new service we have to create a new load balancer also to distribute the traffic

- ingress controller (nginx)
  it have one deployment(which uses the ingress conroller's image), 
  one noreport svc,one configmap, one serviceaccount

- ingress resources
  apiversion: extensions/v1beta1
  kind: Ingress
- if we have a single option we can add servive name/port directly inside spec.backend
  but for more options we have to mention all inside 
  spec.rules.(-http).paths
  which contains path and backend details
- we can also add host field inside spec.rules.(-http,host).paths, which can change the host name as well
  for subdomains
