- the container create a seperate namespace(n/w namespace) which have its own ip/route tables whose
  entries can be different from the entries in th host.
<create network namespace>
- ip netns add <name>
- ip netns command list all the network namespaces
<exec inside the namespace>
- ip netns exec <name>  or use -n <name> suffix in the end of command

- we create a virtual ethernet and connect the two namespace with each other
- ip link add eth1 type veth peer name eth2, it will create a virual ethernet pair
- ip link set eth1 netns <namespace>, it will add the eth to the ns and same for other end too
- ip -n <ns1> addr add <ip> dev eth1, it will assign an ip to the namespace
- ip -n <ns1> link set eth1 up, it will up the connectivity
now we can ping the two namespaces, the entry inside arp table is also added
but the host don''t about these virtual ethernets & connectivity (no entry in arp table)
- if we want to establish a communication b/w multiple namespace we have to create a virtual switch

- ip link add eth3 type bridge, it will create a bridge which is eth for host but switch for namespaces
- ip link set dev eth3 up
- we use the same command to create the eth pairs and then set it with the namespaces
- it will add the ip-addresses after this and up the virtual ethernets

- if we want to access these namespaces from the host, we have to assign an ip to the hsot then
  we can access them
