- we use metrix server for monitor the k8s cluster. it uses in-memory architechture
  stores the data in memory not in disk so unable to retrive the historical data
- we can setup this by cloning the github repo & apply the deploy/1.8+ folder
  Or in minikube we can use minikube addons enable metrics-server
