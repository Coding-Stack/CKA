- it develop the connectivity or comminication between different components.
- we can't access the pod from outside the node directly because of having different network
  so we have to ssh into node and run curl pod-ip command to access the pod
- nodeport svc: listen request to a port in node and forward it to the pod
   its range is 30k to 32767. (nodeport,port,targetport). mapping b/w the svc and port can be done
   by the label and selectors
   pod can be access directly via http://<nodeip>:<nodeport> 
   it is independent of the node (remains available in all nodes)
- kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service (This will automatically use the pod's labels as selectors)
  kubectl create service clusterip redis --tcp=6379:6379 (his will not use the pods labels as selectors,
  instead it will assume selectors as app=redis)
