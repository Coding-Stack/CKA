- we have created the kube-apiserver on the multiple master nodes. All can be available in the active
  state. and the request can be mmanaged by the external load balancer. which can also configured by
  the an extra node.
- the controller manager & scheduler can't be run parallely there will be a chance of a redundancy
  so we ran them active/standby mode one at a time and this status can be managed by the kube-controller-manager-endpoint
  which wait for the response from each controller and faster win the race and other remains in standy mode
- the etcd can be configured in the ran in multiple external node. which is following the distributed architecture
